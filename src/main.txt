When you run a simple "Hello World" program in Java, at least two threads run concurrently

Main Thread: This is the primary thread where the main method is executed.
It handles the execution of your "Hello World" code.

Garbage Collection (GC) Thread: Java automatically starts background threads that manage memory cleanup,
primarily the garbage collector. This thread runs concurrently to ensure efficient memory management
by reclaiming unused objects.

In addition to these, depending on the specific JVM and system configuration,
other threads might also be running, such as:

Finalizer thread: Handles the finalization of objects before they are garbage collected.
JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler thread: Optimizes bytecode to machine code at runtime.
However, for a basic program like "Hello World," the main focus is typically on the
main thread and the garbage collection thread.
